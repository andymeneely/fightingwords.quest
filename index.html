	<h1>Fighting Words</h1>
	<p>

		Ten years after the Major Revision, a group of unlikely words are
		fighting their way back into the narrative.
	</p>

	<p>Fighting Words is a turn-based RPG with roguelike elements, using natural
		language as the basis for procedural generation.</p>

	<p>A video game.</p>
	<p> Coming. </p>
	<p>Someday.</p>
